# LearnX - Full-Stack Learning Platform with Advanced Analytics

LearnX is a comprehensive, full-stack e-learning platform built with React and Firebase. It provides a complete ecosystem for online learning, featuring a user-facing application for students and a powerful, role-based administrative dashboard for content, user, and analytics management.

The application's core is its advanced clickstream tracking system, which logs every meaningful user interactionâ€”from page navigation and video engagement to quiz submissions and administrative actions. This data is collected in a structured format, providing deep, actionable insights into learning patterns and platform usage.

## Local Setup from Repository

To set up and run this project locally from the GitHub repository, follow these steps.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your terminal and clone the project from GitHub.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanchitachaurasia/Learning-Website-with-Clickstream.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    The React application is located in the `client` sub-directory.

    ```bash
    cd Learning-Website-with-Clickstream/client
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the required npm packages.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set Up Firebase Credentials:**

      * Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
      * Enable **Authentication** (with the Email/Password provider), **Firestore Database**, and **Hosting**.
      * In your project's `client` directory, create a new file named `.env.local`.
      * Copy your Firebase project's web app configuration keys into this file. It should look like this:
        ```env
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_SENDER_ID"
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
        ```

5.  **Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The application will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Git Repository Description

A full-stack e-learning platform built with React and Firebase, featuring a complete admin dashboard, user analytics, and a comprehensive clickstream tracking system for detailed learning analytics.

-----

## Firestore Data Structure

The database is structured into four main collections:

  * **`courses`**: Stores course details and a sub-collection for its content.
  * **`users`**: Stores user-specific data like registered courses and progress.
  * **`admins`**: A simple collection where document IDs are the UIDs of admin users, used for role management.
  * **`clickstream`**: Stores all logged user interaction events in a detailed, structured format.

-----

## Clickstream Analytics Implementation

The analytics system uses a hybrid approach for optimal data collection:

1.  **Global Event Listener:** A single listener in `App.js` captures all general UI clicks on elements tagged with a `data-analytics-id` attribute. This is efficient for tracking navigation and simple interactions.
2.  **Manual Event Logging:** For complex, state-dependent events, logging is done manually within the component. This is crucial for capturing:
      * **Time Spent:** Calculated in the `VideoContent` component by tracking play and pause timestamps.
      * **Quiz Scores:** Logged in the `QuizComponent`'s `handleSubmit` function to include the final score and total questions.
      * **Successful Logins/Registrations:** Logged after the asynchronous Firebase authentication call succeeds.

This hybrid model ensures that all required data is captured accurately and efficiently without compromising on detail.
